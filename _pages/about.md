Hi there! My name is George (Γιώργος) and I am a mechanical engineer who loves everything that flies. I am currently finishing up my PhD thesis which was done in collaboration with the University of Nottingham and Airbus Defence and Space in Germany. My work revolves around the stacking sequence optimisation of large-scale composite structures. A typical aircraft wing is manufactured by laying multiple uni-directional pre-impregnated carbon fiber reinforced polymer material strips one on top of the other.  My task has been finsind the optimal number of layers across the span of this aircraft wing and the optimal orientation for each of these layers. In other words I am optimising for the thickness and stiffness distribution of a component which is subject to millions of structural cosntraints and design guidelines while trying to minimise the structural mass.

Before starting my PhD I studied Mechanical Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens. I completed an internship and my diploma thesis in Airbus, Hamburg where I worked on developing a more accurate dynamics-based loads monitoring algorithm for a commercial aircraft in operation. The motivation behind this work is to avoid unecessary inspections on an aircraft following a suspected high-load event during flight. The challenges the algorithm needs to tackle is working in real time on-board an aircraft system with limited computational capabilities using a limited number of available sensor measurements. Besides that, I also worked on the aerodynamic optimisation of a remote controlled, unmanned airplane that represented Euroavia Athens, an association of aerospace students, in the Air Cargo Challenge 2017 inter-university competition.
