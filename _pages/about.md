Hi there! My name is George (Γιώργος) and I am a mechanical engineer. I am currently finishing up my PhD thesis at the University of Nottingham which has been carried out in collaboration with Airbus Defence and Space in Germany. My work revolves around the stacking sequence optimisation of large-scale composite structures. A typical aircraft structure such as a wing, is manufactured by laying multiple uni-directional, carbon fibre reinforced polymer strips one on top of the other. Optimising the stacking sequence involves finding the optimal number of layers across the span of a component and the optimal orientation for each of these layers. In other words, I am optimising for the thickness and stiffness distribution of a component which is subject to millions of structural constraints and design guidelines. The objective function of this optimisation is, in the simplest case, the minimisation of the structural mass.

Before starting my PhD, I studied Mechanical Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens. I completed an internship and my diploma thesis in Airbus in Hamburg, where I worked on developing a more accurate dynamics-based loads monitoring algorithm for a commercial aircraft in operation. The motivation behind this work is to avoid unnecessary inspections on an aircraft, following a suspected high-load event during flight. The challenges the algorithm needs to tackle are working in real time, on-board an aircraft system with restricted computational capabilities using a limited number of available sensor measurements. Besides that, I also worked on the aerodynamic optimisation of a remote-controlled, unmanned airplane that represented Euroavia Athens, an association of aerospace students, in the Air Cargo Challenge 2017 inter-university competition.
